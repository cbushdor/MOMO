FreeBSD-CVSweb is a WWW interface for CVS repositories.

CVSweb was originally written by Bill Fenner and improved by Henner
Zeller, Henrik Nordström, and Ken Coar, then Akinori MUSHA brought
it back to FreeBSD community and made further improvements.  Ville
Skyttä has continued that work.

To track the development, access the MAIN branch of the module
`projects/cvsweb' in the FreeBSD CVS repository.  For legacy 2.x
versions, see the branch named 'rel-2_0-branch'.

Here is the list of added features over Zeller's version:

o Customizable "show functions" option
    You can specify a regexp for each file type to teach rcsdiff(1) to
    recognize function lines.

o Customizable PR categories
o Move $prcgi to cvsweb.conf
    Now each repository can have its own PR categories and
    query-pr.cgi URL, which can be defined in cvsweb.conf-${cvstree}.
    It is useful when you have such as NetBSD and/or OpenBSD
    repositories.

o Improved support for text-based browsers
    Unidiff is the default format for diffs, for text-based browsers.

o Enhanced PR # hyperlinking.
    The following styles are supported.

        PR:     12345, 67890, ..

        PR:     #12345, #67890, ..

        PR#     sparc/12345, i386/67890

        PR:     ports/43210
                kern/98765

        .. is related to bin/4567, which is ...

o Manpage hyperlinking.
    Both `cat(1)' and `cat.1' styles are supported.

o Revision numbers hyperlinking in annotation.

o Automatic tarball generation. (Obtained from Debian)

o Automatic zipball generation.

o Customizable repository entry order.

o Location text field.

o Support for the use of localized charsets.

o Workaround for buggy web servers.

o Numerous bugfixes regarding URI/filename manipulation.

o HTML improvements, XHTML 1.0 Transitional, and a separate CSS file for
  presentation.

o Security fixes to let it work under perl -T.

o Annotate works under mod_perl and against a read only repository.

o CvsGraph <http://www.akhphd.au.dk/~bertho/cvsgraph/> integration.

o Syntax highlighting using GNU Enscript <http://www.iki.fi/~mtr/genscript/>.

o CVSHistory <http://www.jamwt.com/CVSHistory/> integration.

o Line number output for HTMLized views.

o Support for showing README.cvs.html and README.cvs akin to Apache's
  FancyIndexes.

o Support for external diff tools.

o Works with mod_perl >= 1.99_11 as well as 1.2x.

o ...and much more!  See NEWS for high level changes between releases.

See also README, as well as TODO for new features under consideration
and development.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The original Zeller README follows (possibly outdated to some extent):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cgi-script cvsweb.cgi is written by Bill Fenner <fenner@freebsd.org> 
(see [1]) for the freebsd project. It allows browsing of
CVS-repositories (see [2]) with an HTML-browser.

This version is based on Bill's script and is hacked to fit our needs,
so don't blame him if anything doesn't work .. 

Added features:
 - a colored side by side diff
 - easier navigation
 - mime-type aware checkout which allows for browsing
   of version controlled HTML-pages
 - easier configuration - everything configurable is in one
   external file now
 - added cvs-annotate - this requires cvs >= 1.9 
   (tested with cvs 1.10)
 - a better way of viewing timestamps: they're shown as age
   (something like 'changed 2 days 4 hours ago')
 - sorting by filename / age - just click on the corresponding
   column
 - urlencodes all filenames so files with spaces and special
   characters in their names are viewable as well.
 - selectionbox for choosing different CVS-roots
 - overview of last revisionnumber, age and logentry in the 
   directory view
 - you can check out the current revision of a file if you are
   in the directory view (idea from Nick Brachet)
 - gzip'ed output if the browser accepts this; this can reduce the
   size (and download time) by a factor of 4 (directory view) to
   10 (colored diff; the size of the colored diff could be reduced
   with CSS .. anyone ?). The use of gzip has been in the very first
   version of cvsweb (by Bill Fenner), but has been removed because
   it wasn't easy to determine if a browser actually understands it. Today
   the browsers state if they accept the Content-encoding gzip..
   .. but MSIE lies about this (so cvsweb disables gzip-encoding in this
   case).
 - Tag based browsing. An easy and what I think intuitive way to browse a
   CVS tree based on tags, with filtering of files and CVS logs to only
   show whats relevant for the selected tag.
 - "Pretty-printed" checkouts for text based files. My intention is to
   eventually add cross-referencing to this, but for now the file is only
   converted to HTML with automatic detection of various links.
 - "Click-on-version" diff selection.
 - sorting for every column now
 - uses 'cvs co' for checkout instead of rcs co
 - Ability to show directory descriptions from CVSROOT/descriptions

cvsweb.cgi became quite huge now and is bad style code (I am not a
perl-programmer - this is what I do in my spare time!) so this 
should be rewritten. 

I'd propose a Java-servlet which could use the C/S-protocol .. anyone ?

And what about using mod_perl, and rewriting it into a set of proper Perl-5
modules?
